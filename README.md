Deep Learning Techniques for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using Python

Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer deaths worldwide and is the second most common cancer in women and men worldwide. In 2010, it represented about 12 percent of all new cancer cases and 25 percent of all cancers in women while a decade later, the figures have augmented to more than 75% and 89%, respectively. Computer-aided diagnosis provides a most important option for image diagnosis, which can improve the reliability of expertsâ€™ decision-making. Automatic and precision classification for breast cancer histopathological image is of great importance in clinical application for identifying the malignant stage from histopathological images. These systems showed potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Since early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death, it is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible. This project is developed to predict the cancer at the earliest stage using Convolutional Neural Networks from the concept of Deep-Learning and results if the biopsy image is from either benign or malignant category.
